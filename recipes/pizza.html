    <!-- Recipe steps -->
    <ol>
        <li><strong>STEP 1</strong>
            Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml
            warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.
            Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.
            You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but its not essential for a thin crust.
        </li>
        <li><strong>STEP 2</strong>
            Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at
            room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
        </li>
        <li><strong>STEP 3</strong>
            Roll out the dough: if youve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a
            floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough
            needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
        </li>
    </ol>
